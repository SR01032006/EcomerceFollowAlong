# Ecommerce-Follow-Along
### Milestone 1 - Project Overview :    
The Ecommerce-Follow-Along project aims to build a fully-functional e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js)

**Key Features :**   
  - User Authentication: Secure user login and registration functionality.  
  - Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data.  
  - Order Handling: Manage customer orders with backend integration.  
  - REST API: Build scalable and secure APIs for communication between client and server.  
  - MongoDB Schema Design: Design and implement structured data models for managing users, products, and orders.  
  
**Tech Stack :**   
  1. Frontend        : React.js  
  2. Backend         : Node.js, Express.js  
  3. Database        : MongoDB  
  4. Authentication  : JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login  

**Introduction to MERN Stack :** You gained an understanding of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and its role in building full-stack web applications. The lesson highlighted the advantages of using JavaScript across both the frontend and backend, simplifying development.  

**Project Overview :** You were introduced to the goals and key features of the "Ecommerce-Follow-Along" project, which includes user authentication, product management, and order handling, all built with the MERN stack.

**API Structure and Endpoints :** You learned about REST APIs and how they enable communication between the client and server. Key endpoints will be built for user registration, login, product management, and order handling.

**Database Schema Design :** The importance of schema design in MongoDB was covered, with a focus on creating structured models for data like users, products, and orders.

**Authentication Basics :** You learned the significance of user authentication in web applications, ensuring secure access to sensitive resources like purchases and personal information.
